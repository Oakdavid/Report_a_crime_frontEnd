## Frontend Integration

The frontend of this project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a simple and user-friendly interface for reporting crimes and interacting with dashboard data. It consumes the backend API endpoints to handle:

### Key Frontend Behaviors:
- **Optional Login for Reporting**  
  Users can choose to report a crime without logging in or log in to track their reports.

- **User Dashboard**  
  Logged-in users have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view their **past and current reports**, enhancing transparency and accountability.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  Administrators have a separate interface to view and manage all submitted reports.

- **Interactive Visuals**  
  Bar charts display crime trends on the frontend for better insight into reported data.

While basic in design, the frontend effectively demonstrates how the backend powers key application features.
